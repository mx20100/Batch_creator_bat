This script was made by chatgpt. 

You will need several things before using this script.
1. Install python3 and pip
2. Install xlsx2csv using `pip install xlsx2csv`
3. Place the bat file in the folder where the xlsx file is in and run it.

What this script will then do, is convert the xlsx file to a csv, place it in the same folder as the stl files and compress that folder into a zip folder, and in the end cleans up the mess it made.
This makes it easier to upload batches to machines.
